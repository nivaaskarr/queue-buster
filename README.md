# QueueBuster

QueueBuster is a hospital queue management web application that helps reduce patient waiting time and organize doctor consultations in a better way.

The idea behind this project is to simulate how real hospitals manage appointments, queues, and consultations, and to build a practical full-stack application while learning React, Firebase, and backend integration.

This project is currently under development.
